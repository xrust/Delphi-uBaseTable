# Delphi-uBaseTable

### uBaseTable is simple table class unit based on TStringGrid

The table class has auto-adjustment functions, allows dynamically changing column widths, and has a sorting function when clicking on a column header. Since this is a base table, editing and object embedding functions must be implemented in child classes.
